# Elevate

This is a simple clothing webapp developed with FLutter framework and dart, Firebase for the backend.
1. It has authentication using the firebase authentication API's
2. We display all the products from the backend and  enable storing of products using the admin panel
3. The application enables the switching between diisplays or platforms(bigger screens and phone).
4. I used LayoutBulder to differentiate screen sizes and display data accordingly. Some instances use Expanded widget to scale widgets to the desired view.
