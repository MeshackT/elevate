E-commerce Web Application

This is a streamlined e-commerce web application built with Flutter, Firebase, and Bloc for state management.
The platform serves as a clothing store, featuring three distinct categories: Men, Women, and Kids.

The application includes a robust authentication system that allows authorized users to post new clothing items to the store.
Once added, the data is efficiently retrieved and displayed on the front end, providing a smooth and responsive shopping experience for customers.
